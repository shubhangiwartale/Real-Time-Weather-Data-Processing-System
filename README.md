## Project Overview
This **Real-Time Data Processing System** captures, processes, and stores real-time weather data from various sources. By performing rollups and aggregations, it allows efficient analysis of weather trends, real-time monitoring, and alert notifications for predefined thresholds.

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Ingests weather data from multiple sources.
- **Data Processing**: Transforms and cleans incoming data streams.
- **Aggregation & Rollups**: Hourly, daily, and weekly rollups for efficient long-term analysis.
- **Alert System**: Configurable alerts for abnormal conditions.
- **Historical Data Access**: Supports querying historical weather data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Dashboards display real-time and historical data trends.

## System Architecture
- **Data Ingestion**: Real-time data is fed into the system using Kafka or MQTT.
- **Processing**: Apache Spark/Flink processes data for transformations, aggregations, and rollups.
- **Storage**: Time-series databases like InfluxDB, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL store real-time and rollup data.
- **Visualization**: Grafana or custom dashboards present real-time data insights and alerts.

## Tech Stack
- **Data Ingestion**: Kafka, MQTT
- **Processing Framework**: Apache Spark, Apache Flink
- **Storage**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL (time-series support), InfluxDB
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Visualization**: Grafana

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Kafka and Spark**: Install and configure for data ingestion and processing

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/real-time-weather-processing.git
   cd real-time-weather-processing
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**: 
   Update `.env` file with configurations for Kafka, database credentials, and alert thresholds.

3. **Build and Run with Docker**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This starts all services, including Kafka, Spark, MongoDB, and Grafana.

## Usage

### Data Ingestion
- Real-time weather data can be fed into Kafka, which the processing layer consumes.

### Rollups and Aggregations
- Scheduled Spark/Flink jobs process incoming data and create rollups (e.g., hourly, daily).

### Visualization
1. Access Grafana at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Use preconfigured dashboards to view real-time weather data, historical trends, and rollups.

### Alerts
- Alerts are triggered based on threshold conditions (e.g., extreme temperatures) and can be viewed in the visualization dashboard or sent to Slack/email if configured.

## Configuration

- **Kafka**: Configure topic and broker details in the `config/kafka_config.json`.
- **Database**: Set up database credentials in `.env` or configuration file.
- **Spark/Flink**: Configure batch job intervals and checkpointing.
- **Alerts**: Customize alert thresholds for each weather parameter in the config file.

## Dependencies
The system relies on the following dependencies:
- **Apache Kafka**: Message broker for real-time data streaming
- **Apache Spark/Flink**: Data processing framework for transformations and aggregations
- **MongoDB/PostgreSQL/InfluxDB**: Storage solution for real-time and historical data
- **Grafana**: Visualization tool for monitoring data trends
